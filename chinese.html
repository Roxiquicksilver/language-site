      <h1>Mandarin</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <p id="top-of-page">I first started studying Mandarin Chinese at Xiamen University, Fujian Province, China. I had an amazing experience there and after five months I was between level 4 and 5 on the HSK. Since then I have lived in Japan and then moved back to my native England, and as can be imagined, my Mandarin skills have fluctuated… a lot! </p>
        <br>
        <p> Last year, I decided to study Mandarin seriously again and in December I passed HSK 4. I intend to take HSK 5 this year. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am now going to introduce the learning materials that I use, in no particular order.</p>
        <h3>Pleco</h3>
        <p>This is my favourite Chinese learning resource and I always have it downloaded on my phone. I do not have the Cantonese version but it also supports Cantonese.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pleco is a mainly a dictionary, it can be used offline and is very easy to use. I like it so much because it has so many functions , some of which are listed below.</p>
        <ul class="chinese-list">
          <li>Flashcards</li>
          <p>I try to go through these once a day. You can download cards or create them yourselves. You can also change the amount of cards you look at in one setting. If you want to spend only 5 minutes then 20 cards is a good amount. I recently increased the number of cards to 75 because I wanted to go through more words but I don’t manage to finish them in one sitting so I think I will reduce them soon. </p>
          <br>
          <p> I downloaded the whole of the HSK 1- 5. Last year I went through all the HSK words from levels 1 to 4 but I have changed the filter and now only go through HSK 5 vocab. </p>
          <br>
          <p> To be honest I feel the cards I receive are quite random and I don’t really understand the algorithm, however I try to mark the cards I got wrong or want to go over again quite soon as wrong and the rest as right. It doesn’t save stats. This may sound like a flaw but the reason I stopped using other flashcards is you create a debt if you do not do them every day. This was off putting for me, so the casualness of the flashcards works for me but may not work for everyone. </p>
          <li>Input methods</li>
          <p>You can put in English, pinyin or Chinese characters. There is a toggle to make Pleco know which language you are inputting but I barely use this as it will automatically detect. It does come in useful sometimes when words sound similar in pinyin or English and Pleco has become confused.</p>
          <li>Day and night mode</li>
          <p>This is a feature I didn’t know existed until very recently.</p>
          <li>EBook reader</li>
          <p>It is possible to download eBooks such as the Graded reader series, which leads me on nicely to the next learning resource I am about to introduce.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Graded Chinese Reader series</h3>
        <img class="graded-reader" src="img/chinese-reader.jpg" alt="Graded reader front cover"/>
        <p>This series comprises of six books, increasing incrementally in difficulty. This is what I use to improve my reading skills and so far I have read the 1500 words and some of the 3000 words. I think I will also read the 2000 and 2500 words volumes as well.</p>
        <ul class="chinese-list">
          <li>Style of the book</li>
          <p>The book is divided into short stories, written with the original Chinese characters with pinyin above. It also contains a pinyin-invisible card to cover the pinyin if you want to focus on Chinese characters. To be honest, I found that the pinyin-invisible card was quite awkward to use as it would not stay in place, for this reason and as I explain below, I stopped using it and now only use it as a bookmark.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The book has no translation. At first this was daunting but once I got into the story it was ok. There is a translation of the words not contained in the words you should know, and sometimes example sentences.</p>
          <li>Pleco version</li>
          <p>As I already bought the books before I noticed that they could be purchased on Pleco, I only downloaded the free first short story. I enjoyed reading on Pleco because you could look up every word you did not know quite easily. It is also really portable and can be read on your phone where ever you are.</p>
