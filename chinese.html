      <h6>I first started studying Mandarin Chinese at Xiamen University, Fujian Province, China. I had an amazing experience there and after five months I was between level 4 and 5 on the HSK. Since then I have lived in Japan and then moved back to my native England, and as can be imagined, my Mandarin skills have fluctuated… a lot!</h6>
      <h6>Last year, I decided to study Mandarin seriously again and in December I passed HSK 4. I intend to take HSK 5 this year. I am now going to introduce the learning materials that I use, in no particular order.</h6>
      <h3>Pleco</h3>
      <h6>This is my favourite Chinese learning resource and I always have it downloaded on my phone. I do not have the Cantonese version but it also supports Cantonese.</h6>
      <h6>Pleco is a mainly a dictionary, it can be used offline and is very easy to use. I like it so much because it has so many functions , some of which are listed below.</h6>
      <ul class="chinese-list">
        <li>Flashcards</li>
        <li>Input methods</li>
        <li>Day and night mode</li>
        <h6>This is a feature I didn’t know existed until very recently.</h6>
        <li>EBook reader</li>
        <h6>It is possible to download eBooks such as the Graded reader series, which leads me on nicely to the next learning resource I am about to introduce.</h6>
      </ul>
      <h3>Graded Chinese Reader series</h3>
      <h6>This series comprises of six books, increasing incrementally in difficulty. This is what I use to improve my reading skills and so far I have read the 1500 words and some of the 3000 words. I think I will also read the 2000 and 2500 words volumes as well.</h6>
